Using Collaborative Filtering -  Model-based In this approach, models are developed using different machine learning algorithms to recommend items to users. There are many model-based CF algorithms, like Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks, Clustering Techniques, and Latent Factor Models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis.
